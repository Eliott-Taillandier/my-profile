<h2>Skills, Activities & Interests</h2>
<p>
<li>English Language. I learned to speak and comprehend English on my own, watching TV shows.

My English levels are also sufficient for me to engage complex cultural and professional discussions Economically & Geopolitically centred.</li>
<li>Outdoor Sports Practice. My early teenage years have mostly been spent within my rowing club, hence developing a strong bond with outdoor activities. Aside from my competitive practice of rowing, I also savour bike riding, either on or off track, same applying to my ski practice ; along with long walks, swimming or paddle boarding sessions to clear my mind.</li>
<li>Architecture & Design. I have found myself a profound interest in architecture and efficient design, mainly focusing on anticipating tomorrow's climatic conditions and find a balance between comfort, austerity and ergonomic constraints.</li>
